Introduction
============

Addition to Plone's ATContentTypes's ATEvent to support referenced venues.

So, Content Editors must not type in a venue location each and every time an
event happens but can choose from a list of previously added venues.


TODO
====

- Internationalize it
- Write tests
- Provide location attribute and getLocation getter which get their values from
  either venue or venue_notes. Done via an adpater?
- Bump version to 1.0 after that is done
